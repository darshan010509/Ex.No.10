AIM

To demonstrate how various prompting techniques—such as query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, chain-of-thought, and persona prompting—can be used to create different forms of content (reports, articles, case studies, comics, etc.) using AI models. The aim is to analyze how these prompt structures influence the quality, coherence, creativity, and organization of the generated output.

INTRODUCTION

Prompt engineering determines how effectively an AI model generates content. Strong, well-structured prompts bring clarity and depth, whereas vague prompts can lead to inaccurate or shallow output. This experiment explores multiple prompting patterns and their impact on content creation across different formats—reports, articles, case studies, and creative formats.

PROMPT PATTERNS USED

Below are the prompting strategies demonstrated in the experiment:

1. Query Decomposition Prompting

This approach breaks a complex request into simpler sub-tasks.
Purpose: Improves accuracy by allowing the model to address each component step-by-step.

2. Decision-Making Prompting

The model is instructed to analyze options and choose the most appropriate direction.
Purpose: Useful in scenario analysis, case studies, strategies, and recommendations.

3. Semantic Filtering Prompting

User specifies the style, tone, scope, and exclusions.
Purpose: Ensures the content matches specific constraints and remains relevant.

4. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Prompts instruct the model to “think step-by-step.”
Purpose: Enhances logical flow, reasoning, and coherence.

5. Persona-Based Prompting

The model assumes a role (e.g., professor, researcher, journalist).
Purpose: Helps maintain consistent tone and expert-level delivery.

EXPERIMENT ALGORITHMS

Step 1: Select a Content Topic

For demonstration, we use the topic “Impact of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare.”

Step 2: Apply Each Prompt Pattern
Outputs & Analysis
A. Using Query Decomposition

Prompt:
“Break the topic into: (1) Introduction, (2) Key AI applications, (3) Benefits, (4) Challenges, (5) Conclusion. Generate each section with 150 words.”

Output Quality:

Highly structured

Comprehensive

Minimal missing details
Use Case: Reports, academic assignments

B. Using Decision-Making Prompting

Prompt:
“Identify the three most impactful AI applications in healthcare and justify why they are more significant than others. Then write a short article based on your decision.”

Output Quality:

Prioritizes information

Includes justification

Produces analytical content
Use Case: Case studies, analytical reports

C. Using Semantic Filtering

Prompt:
“Write a 500-word article on AI in healthcare. Maintain a neutral tone, avoid technical jargon, exclude mentions of robotics, and focus only on diagnosis and prediction.”

Output Quality:

Controlled scope

High relevance

Follows restrictions precisely
Use Case: Articles for general audiences, blogs

D. Using Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Prompt:
“Explain step-by-step how AI improves early disease detection. Then convert the reasoning into a 300-word report section.”

Output Quality:

Deep logical reasoning

Clear explanation

More coherence
Use Case: Research explanations, academic reports

E. Using Persona Prompting

Prompt:
“Act as a senior medical researcher and write a case study on how AI helped reduce diagnostic errors in a hospital.”

Output Quality:

Strong professional tone

Domain-specific language

Reads like a real case study
Use Case: Case studies, professional reports

CONCLUSION

* Different prompt patterns significantly affect the quality, structure, and tone of content generated by AI models.

* Query decomposition ensures completeness and structure.

* Decision-making prompts improve analytical depth.

* Semantic filtering maintains relevance and avoids unwanted content.

* Chain-of-thought enhances reasoning quality.

*  Persona prompting delivers expert-level writing with consistent voice.

* By strategically selecting the prompt pattern, creators can generate high-quality reports, articles, case studies, and even creative formats like comic plots. This demonstrates that prompt engineering is a powerful skill essential for effective AI-assisted content creation.
